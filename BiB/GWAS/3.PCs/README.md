The third step is to calculate the Principal Components (PCs). 
100 PCs for UK Biobank were generated using pcapred/flashPCA package. 
40 local PCs were calculated and a scree plot was generated to select a sufficient number of PCs that represent the most variations in the data. 
The data were then projected to the PCs from both datasets.
