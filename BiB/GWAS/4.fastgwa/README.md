We used fastGWA because this software accounts for population stratification and relatedness. We made an automated script to run the GWAS for all the phenotypes. However, as we have >20 phenotypes, we ran the GWAS for categorical and continuous variables separately. We further separated the GWAS on mothers’ and fetal/newborns’ phenotypes.
